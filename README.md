# Community Waiting List Regional Analysis
## NHS South West Intelligence and Insights Team

### About the Project

This study investigates strategies for eliminating community waiting lists exceeding 52 weeks within Community Health Services (CHS) and also exploring the potential for achieving 92% target at 18 weeks as an aspiration to bring community waits in line with more established elective care waiting lists. Utilising data from CHS SitReps, it analyses key metrics of load and pressure at both provider and service levels. Queuing theory is applied to current waiting times to forecast future performance and determine the additional capacity needed to achieve national targets and future aspirations. Furthermore, the analysis quantifies the ongoing capacity required to maintain a steady state on the waiting list, preventing future backlogs. This research provides actionable insights for optimising resource allocation and improving patient access to community health services.

### Getting Started

#### Installation

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

Clone the repo

### Usage
Data is drawn from NHSE Udal data warehouse.

This is dataset 456 Community Health Services SitRep

Similar data data for this code is can ve obtained obtain from NHS futures, unfortunately it is in a different format.

https://future.nhs.uk/CommunityHealthServices/view?objectId=16189616

The report runs by NHS England region to show regional and local ICB comparisons.

You can select the region that the report runs against at the start of the code. 

The main engine of the analysis is based on the NHSR  Waiting list project.

#### Outputs
The report produces an interactive quarto document.

#### Datasets
Data from this code is taken from UDAL NHSE Data warehouse.  If you have access you will need to run report in UDAL enviorment.

It could be altered to run from publically available data.
